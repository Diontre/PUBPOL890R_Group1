# 1) For each of the sample tables, describe what each observation
# and each column represents.

# In table1, each row represents the number of TB cases in a given year
# in a given country with a given population. The column variables are therefore
# country, year, cases, and population.

# In table2, each row represents one numerical data point, either TB case count
# or population count, in a given country in a given year. The column variables
# are therefore country, year, type (cases or population), and count.

# In table3, each row represents the TB case rate in a given country in a given
# year. The column variables are therefore country, year, and rate.

# 2) Sketch out the process you’d use to calculate the rate for table2 and
# table3. You will need to perform four operations:
#   a) Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
#   b) Extract the matching population per country per year.
#   c) Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
#   d) Store back in the appropriate place.
# You haven’t yet learned all the functions you’d need to actually perform
# these operations, but you should still be able to think through the
# transformations you’d need.

# For table3, calculating the rate per 10,000 people is a simple task. The rows
# are already separated by country by year, and the base rate is given. All we
# need to do is mutate a new rate variable by multiplying the current "rate"
# variable by 10000.

# The process for table2 is much trickier and requires reshaping the dataframe.

# The reshape function combines rows together by country and year.

table2_cases <-
  table2_combine |> 
  mutate(table2_combine,
       cases_per_10k = count.cases / count.population * 10000)

# Finally, mutate creates a new column to present cases per 10,000 people.
