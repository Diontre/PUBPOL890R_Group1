#Exercise 5.2.1

#1. Each observation I am observing the rate of Tuberculosis growing in each
#year. Each column represents the 
#locations that are being observed(population), the time period that is being
#measured(year), the number of cases happening within the year, and the size of
#the scale of the people impacted(population).

#2.Sketch out the process youâ€™d use to calculate the rate for table2 and table3. 
#You will need to perform four operations:

#Extract the number of TB cases per country per year.
table2 |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarize(total_cases = sum(cases))

table2 |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarize(total_cases = sum(cases))

#Extract the matching population per country per year.
table2 |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarize(population, country)

#Divide cases by population, and multiply by 10000.
table2 |>
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
