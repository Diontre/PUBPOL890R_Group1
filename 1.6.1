# 1) Run the following lines of code.
# Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")

library(png)

mpgPNG1 <- readPNG("C:/Users/eptic/Documents/mpg-plot.png")

grid::grid.raster(mpgPNG1)

# Only the scatterplot was saved as a .png file because it's
# the most recent ggplot argument.

# 2) What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF
# instead of a PNG? How could you find out what types of image files
# would work in ggsave()?

?ggsave

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.pdf")

# Reviewing the documentation of ggsave confirms that it supports .pdf
# documents. Changing the filename extension to .pdf creates a PDF
# instead of a .png file.
