# 1) How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?

view (penguins)
# penguins has 344 entries (rows) and 8 columns.

# 2) What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe?
# Read the help for ?penguins to find out.

?penguins
# The bill_depth_mm variable denotes the depth
# of each penguin's bill in millimeters.

# 3) Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm.
# That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis
# and bill_length_mm on the x-axis.
# Describe the relationship between these two variables.

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Bill length and depth",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Species", shape = "Species") +
  scale_color_colorblind()
# The scatterplot shows that as bill length increases, bill depth decreases.

# 4) What happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm?
# What might be a better choice of geom?

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bill depth by penguin species",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Penguin species", y = "Bill depth (mm)", color = "Species",
       shape = "Species") +
  scale_color_colorblind()
# This plot shows the range of each species bill depth,
# but it's difficult to see individual data points this way.
# I would use a boxplot geometry to show average bill length by species
# to view the bill depth range more clearly.

# 5) Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?
ggplot(data = penguins) +
geom_point()

# The code above generates this error: "geom_point()` requires the
# following missing aesthetics: x and y"
# To fix this, we need to specify which variables we want to display on our
# scatterplot axes.

# 6) What does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()?
# What is the default value of the argument?
# Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.

# the rm argument removes values from a dataset, so the na.rm argument removes
# missing (N/A) values. The default value of this argument is FALSE,
# because R won't remove values in calculations by default.
# The scatterplot below specifies na.rm = TRUE
# so the graph removes the missing values before plotting it.
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Bill length and depth",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Species", shape = "Species") +
  scale_color_colorblind()

# 7) Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise:
# “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.”
# Hint: Take a look at the documentation for labs().

?labs
ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species), na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Bill length and depth",
       subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
       caption = "Data come from the palmerpenguins package.",
       x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Species", shape = "Species") +
  scale_color_colorblind()

# 8) Recreate the following visualization.
library(png)
download.file(
  "https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png",
  destfile = "C:/Users/eptic/Downloads/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png", mode = 'wb')
visual1 <- readPNG('C:/Users/eptic/Downloads/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png')
grid::grid.raster(visual1)
# What aesthetic should bill_depth_mm be mapped to?
# And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?

# bill_depth_mm should be mapped to the color of the data points.
# This mapping should be mapped at the geom_point level,
# since the global variables don't include bill_depth_mm.

ggplot(data = penguins, mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                                      y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = bill_depth_mm), na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth()
  scale_color_colorblind()

# 9) Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like.
# Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
# ggplot(data = penguins,
# mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)) +
# geom_point() +
# geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

# My predictions: this will generate a scatterplot comparing
# the flipper length of penguins to their body mass, with colors showing
# which penguins live on each island. There will be an overlayed regression
# line without confidence intervals around the line showing the direction of
# the relationship.
  
ggplot(data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

# My prediction about the regression line was incorrect because the graph
# generated a line for each island. The rest of my predictions were correct.
  
# 10) Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?
# ggplot(data = penguins,
# mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
# geom_point() +
# geom_smooth()

# ggplot() +
# geom_point(data = penguins,
# mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
# geom_smooth(data = penguins,
# mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

# These two graphs should look the same. The first graph set the parameters
# at a global level, applying them to both geom layers. The second graph set
# the parameters at a local level, but both geom layers have the exact same
# parameters as those set at the global level in the first graph.
