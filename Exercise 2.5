#1. Why does this code not work?
#my_variable <- 10
#my_varıable
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'my_varıable' not found
#Answer: The error appeared because the instructions for this assignment were 
# specific enough for R to process.

#2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes (x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes (x = displ, y = hwy), method = "lm")

#3. If I press Alt + Shift + K/Option + Shift + K, then I am able to see all of
#the shortcuts to certain commands on R that can be done using the keyboard. 
# This can also be found under the "Tool" window.

#4.Answer: The plot that is saved as a png is the bar plot was saves. In the 
#command ggsave it was specified to save the bar plot as a png. 
my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)
