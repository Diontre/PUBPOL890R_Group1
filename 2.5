# 2.5 Exercise

# 1) Why does this code not work?

my_variable <- 10
my_varıable

# The object "my_varıable" has the wrong character for "i", instead using "ı"

# 2) Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

libary(todyverse)

ggplot(dTA = mpg) + 
  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm)
"
# ^I have to close the open quotation marks before I can code the correction!
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), method = "lm")
# The code is littered with errors, including misspelling,
# improper capitalization, and missing punctuation.

# 3) Press Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K. What happens?
# How can you get to the same place using the menus?

# It opens the keyboard shortcut dialog window. You can also find it in the
# ribbon under the Tools tab.

# 4) Let’s revisit an exercise from the Section 1.6.
# Run the following lines of code.
my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)
# Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

# This time, the bar plot was saved because the assignment operator allowed
# the ggsave argument to specify which plot was saved as a PNG.
